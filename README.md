# Collect-Forecast-Visualize
Collect, Forecast, &amp; Visualize â€“ Global Electricity Generation Data

A collaboration between multiple nonprofits, governments, and tech companies is currently building [an AI](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/5/7/18530811/global-power-plants-real-time-pollution-data) to continuously monitor pollution from every power plant in the world from space, using satellite data.

A crucial component of that system is its ability to be trained on a sufficiently large and accurate training dataset. This will be a mix of readily available satellite imagery, combined with accurate ground truth generation data. The purpose of this project is to help build that ground truthing system. Students will implement real-time scrapers for web-based data from power grids around the world and analyze the data for accuracy. 

A forecasting model will be implemented to predict future generation values and a front-end tool will be created to visualize the collected data. 

### Additional info:
Students will be working within a framework provided by WattTime which already includes a robust ETL pipeline, database, and significant support on where to find data and how to interpret it.

## Project Outcome:
  1. Python code that will sit within an existing WattTime tool which will automatcially scrape, test, and correct data
  2. Forecasting model
  3. Front-end visualization tool of the data

## Technologies:
### This project has four components:
  1. Write scrapers, likely in Python, to scrape data from power grid websites around the world. 
  2. Analyze the scraped data for accuracy. (For example, many coal-fired power plants report emissions that are exactly 1,000 times smaller than is possible, which is a clear sign that they are reporting in the wrong units.) 
  3. Create a forecasting model to predict future generation values 
  4. Build a tool to visualize the data
